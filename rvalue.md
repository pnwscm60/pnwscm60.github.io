    <h2>Why to hold the r-value low</h2>
    <div class="twocol">

      There are probably only a few people knowing the meaning of the <a href="#ref1" id="rref1">r-value</a> 6 months ago. Today, the r-value is omnipresent in print and social media. As officials from the health agencies worldwide have repeated every day, many people know today, that the r-value should be below 1. A value above 1 would mean, that we have an exponential growth of infections. But most people do probably not understand, while it is important to hold the r-value as low as possible. We try to give a short explanation.

   What does the r-value tell us exactly? Rhe r-value shows, how bigger (or smaller) the next generation will be. Let's assume, Person 0 is infected and infects two other persons, and each infected person infects two others, so r = 2. So, we start with generation g0 = 1, the second generation will be g0&#183;r = 2, the third g0&#183;r^2 = 4, and so on. So we have  1, 2, 4, 8, 16, cases and this sum goes up. It will be slow down, when the number of infected people rises, as it will take a longer time to find an non-infected person.
