    <h2>Estimation of Rt in Swiss Cantons</h2>
    <div>Kevin Systrom published an interesting article about the realtime estimation of Rt. Systrom based his publication on a Paper from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002185">Bettenvourt & Ribeiro</a>, «Real Time Bayesian Estimation of the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Infectious Diseases». They used Bayesian statistics to estimate the most likely value of Rt and a credible interval for the true value of Rt. We used the method described by Systrom to estimate Rt for Swiss cantons with over 750 cases since the beginning of the epidemic. Smaller case numbers result as expected in wider density intervals. </div>
