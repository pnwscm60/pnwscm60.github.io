    <h2>Estimation of Rt in Swiss Cantons</h2>
    <div>Kevin Systrom published an interesting article about the realtime estimation of Rt. Systrom based his publication on a Paper from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002185">Bettenvourt & Ribeiro</a>, «Real Time Bayesian Estimation of the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Infectious Diseases». They used Bayesian statistics to estimate the most likely value of Rt and a credible interval for the true value of Rt. We used the method described by Systrom to estimate the Rt</div>
